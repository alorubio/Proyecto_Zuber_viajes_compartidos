# Analysis of passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on ridesharing

## Objective
Zuber is a new ridesharing company launching in Chicago.

The objective is to find patterns in the available information. To understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on trips.

Additionally, we will work with databases to analyze competitors' data and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on trip frequency.

The hypothesis to be tested is the following:
"The average trip duration from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."

For this, the significance level (alpha) is established.
